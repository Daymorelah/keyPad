# keyPad

This is a simple code that interfaces a keypad with a micro-controller. An LCD (16 by 2) is used to display
the input pressed on the keypad. It uses an 8-bit ATmega-32 micro-controller to interface the keypad and
the LCD display.

The souce doe was written in [ visual studio code v6](http://www.atmel.com/tools/atmelstudio.aspx). All port
numbers used to interface both the LCD and keypad are well documented in the source code.

You can get the datasheet for the micro-controller used here [ATmega-32 Datasheet](http://www.atmel.com/images/Atmel-8271-8-bit-AVR-Microcontroller-ATmega48A-48PA-88A-88PA-168A-168PA-328-328P_datasheet_Complete.pdf).
